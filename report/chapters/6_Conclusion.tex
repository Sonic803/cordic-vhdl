\chapter{Final considerations}
The design process adopted in this work demonstrates an efficient approach to implementing the CORDIC algorithm. The iterative methodology ensures high accuracy while maintaining low resource utilization, as confirmed by the Vivado synthesis and power analysis reports. 

It is important to note that while the implemented circuit is tailored for the constraints of the Zybo board, the modularity of the design makes it adaptable to other hardware platforms. The testing and verification phase, which included testbenches and graphical analysis, validated the functionality and robustness of the system across a wide range of input conditions.
