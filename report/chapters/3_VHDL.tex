\section{CORDIC}
The following code shows the implementation of the CORDIC in vectoring mode for Cartesian to polar conversion. This implementation supports the fixed step for accepting inputs in all 4 quadrants, and also normalizes $\rho$. As said in Section \ref{sec:algorithm_implementation}, we followed a Finite State Machine (FSM) approach where the control part uses a status register represented as \texttt{current\_state}.

\section{Atan LUT}
The values of the LUT table were calculated using the formula:
\[
    \text{LUT}_i = \left\lfloor \text{atan}(2^{-i} )* 2^{21} \right\rfloor
\]
